Every year, over a million children are reported missing around the world. According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, NCIC, every year, 460,000 children are reported missing in the United States alone. This, however, is only a fraction of the number of children who are actually missing; many missing cases aren’t even reported, and the database is also not very accurate for a few countries. Especially in countries like India, amber alerts aren’t very popular, and with its large population, it becomes very hard to trace abduction cases.

In this project, we try to work on resolving the real-life problems people and police face while searching for a missing child. We intend to create an app that improves the efficiency of the process of finding missing children and also increases the odds of locating a lost child. We do so by the implication of Practical AI; connecting our app with a machine learning model trained over a large dataset for face recognition will give enormous power to the general public, in their hands, to contribute towards the process of locating a lost child.

With the help of this app, a person can scan the face of a child whom that person believes to be a potentially missing child. Our app will compare the scanned face to the database of lost children and send an alert email to the police department and the family of the child regarding the location of the child if a match is found. This app will not only help in locating lost children more efficiently, but it will also help the police to locate sources of child abductors, thereby reducing the cases of child abduction.
